PyTolemy
========

Greek astronomical calculator.

First project in Python, created to help perform the sexigesimal calculations essential to studying the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's <i>Almagest</i>.

Ptolemy exclusively uses sexigesimal values, and uses chords to describe arclengths. This program launches a primitive command-line interface to convert between base 10 and base 60, arcs and chords, and find the Zodiac position of a given value.
